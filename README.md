NearBT
======

A pluggable authentication module (PAM) on OS X for local authentication with iOS devices (NearBT installed) via Bluetooth LE.

With NearBT, you can,
---------------------

- Unlock OS X screen saver without typing password (just type return). *No need to store your password.*
- Add an extra authentication to log in OS X in addition to password. It works like two-factor authentication.
- Also works on authentication dialogs when you make changes on some preferences, and `sudo` command in Terminal.

Features
--------

### Security

* OS X passwords are not saved somewhere regardless of whether passwords are encrypted.
* iOS device identifiers are used in Bluetooth connections.
* Bluetooth pairing is required.
* Time-based One-time Password Algorithm ([TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)) is used to authenticate.
* Open source for both OS X and iOS.

### Energy

* Only create a connection when an authentication starts. Stop the connection once the authentication finishes.
* Thanks to Bluetooth Low Energy, it's about 1% in 7 days from iOS's battery usage report.

### Customization

* Minimum RSSI (received signal strength indicator). Higher values reduce the valid scope of iOS devices.
* Run scripts when authentication begins or if authentication succeeds or fails.

Run `pam_nearbt-setup parameters` for more details.

  sudo rm /usr/local/bin/pam_nearbt-setup
  ```

2. If you want to remove all configuration files,
  ```
